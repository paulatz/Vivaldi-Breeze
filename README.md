# Vivaldi-Breeze
Tweaks to the Vivaldi browser to match KDE/Plasma Breeze theme. 
In order to add these tweaks to Vivaldi, place the CSS files in a new folder,
then go to vivaldi://experiments/ and enable "Allow for using CSS modifications",
finally in vivaldi://settings/ got to Custom UI Modifications and select the folder above.

1. tabs.css: change the look of tabs to match more closely the one of KDE. Should be used with a theme with the following settings
(you can use the accent color or not according to your taste)

2. buttons.css: if you want to use the non-native window (which saves quite a bit of vertical space),
3. this file will reskin the maximize/minimize/close buttons to match
4. (as closely as possible) those of Breeze window decorations.
5. non-native-window-with-shadow-kde.mp4: a little tutorial that shows how to have window shadow when using non-native window.
